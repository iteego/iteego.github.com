<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
Iteego ("Iteego" or "we") is committed to protecting the privacy of the personally-identifiable
information that we collect from you as you use this Web site (the "Site"). The scope of Iteego's
commitment is detailed in this Privacy Policy. By submitting information, you agree to Iteego's use
of such information as described herein. Please see our Terms of Use for more information about our
on-line policies in general.
</p>
<br/>
<h3>What personally-identifiable information is collected?</h3>
<p>
Iteego collects personally-identifiable information ("Personal Info") on certain areas of the Site
when users register, request information or a response, sign up for events, apply for jobs, and
participate in user posting areas, such as bulletin boards, discussion forums, and surveys. The
personally-identifiable information collected may include, without limitation, your access
ID/password, company or school affiliations, and contact information (names, mailing and e-mail
addresses, phone/ fax numbers).
</p>
<br/>
<h3>How may my Personal Info be used?</h3>
<p>
Iteego uses your Personal Info to fulfill your requests for information, to process your requests
to participate in events, and to review and consider any employment-related inquiries that you may
submit. We may keep any of your Personal Info on file and use it to contact you for recruiting
purposes. Iteego may also use Personal Info in analyzing Site user behavior in order to measure
interest in specific items posted on our Site. The e-mail addresses provided at registration allow
Iteego to send e-mail to individuals based on the areas of interest that they indicate during the

5. If Iteego and/or any of its affiliates merges with or sells substantially all of its assets or a
majority of its equity to a third party, information collected by Iteego or such affiliates on their
Web sites may be disclosed to and owned by the merged entity or third party.
</li>
</ul>
