      <h2>welcome</h2>
      <p class="text3">Iteego has specialized in bridging the gap between new software and actual business requirements since 2002. We are experts in minimizing cost and maximizing returns in large-scale e-commerce implementation and enterprise software integration.</p>
      <p class="text3">We pride ourselves in being a leading provider of continuous delivery in large-scale application development and we deliver results in productivity that has yet to be matched in the industry.</p>
      <br />
      <span class="text2">Times have changed</span>
      <p>The way we look at enterprise software today is radically different from how we saw things five years ago. There is a higher level of maturity in software platforms, which enables companies to leverage a larger amount of functionality in shorter implementation cycles.</p>
      <p>
      <span class="text3">These are exciting times!</span>
      <p></p>On the same token, with additional functionality comes higher cost. More advanced software also brings a new challenge to the table - finding domain knowledge to lead the implementation of your business systems.
      <p></p>As a result, companies find that although they have invested record amounts in new platforms, they spend even more on implementation - both in project time lines and domain knowledge acquisition. After all is said and done, you are left wondering:</p>
      <span class="text3">
        <ul>
          <li>"what happened to minimizing our cost?"</li>
          <li>"what about the 9-month ROI I was promised?"</li>
        </ul>
      </span>
      <p>The answer to this issue is hidden in the methods used. In order to achieve true productivity, it is imperative that modern methods be used. Iteego recognizes this need and has developed the first true producitivty platform to address it. You will find details under the products section.</p>
      <p>The Iteego team consists of Oracle Commerce Professionals, Web Designers, Project Managers, experts in JAVA and J2EE software development, legacy system integration, custom application development and operational management.</p>
