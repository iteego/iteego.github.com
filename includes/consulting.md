## THE ITEEGO APPROACH

[back to solutions](..)

At iteego we believe in simplicity. For almost a decade, we have followed the following
three basic rules:

* [1. You can only manage what you can see](atg-best-practices)
Iteego will help you add visibility to your projects by utilizing proven, simple methods and
processes to gather requirements, design proof-of-concepts, measure results and help map your
business to feasible plans in technology.
* [2. You can only change what you can reach](atg-business-consulting)
It is our belief that if you take a practical approach to solving problems, you will end up with a
practical solution. It is also our belief that the reverse is true. You will find that with the
Iteego team at your disposal, you will be as close to your project as if you had done it yourself.
* [3. You can only control what you can understand](atg-performance)
Finally, how can you make decisions around your IT investments if you cannot understand how all
this technology maps to your business? The Itego team takes great pride in being a leader in
bridging the gap between technology and business - putting the business owner in the driver's seat.
